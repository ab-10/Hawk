# Hawk

Hawk aims to provide transparent and explainable functionality for obtaining properties of words and determining whether triples of words are _discriminative_.
## What does that mean?
__Discriminative triples__ are triples of words where there's a significantly stronger relationship between the first and third word than the first and third. For example, triple _hawk,elephant,flies_ is discriminative, but _hawk,elephant,animal_ is not.

## How can I use it?
The best way to use Hawk is through the API.
We don't have a public endpoint (yet), so you'll have to run a local instance though. So:
1. Download the .tar.gz
2. `tar -xf` it^
3. `java --jar theFile.jar locationToIndexesDirectory`
4. Now you should be able to access the API on `localhost:8080/`, nois!

## How can I contribute?
First of all thanks for showing interest in Hawk!
These are the recommended steps for contributing:
1. Play around with Hawk. 
Take a look at the usage instructions above and try building something (think hackathon-level project). In case you produce something decent, we'd be happy to list it as an example (thus accepting your first contribution), however the point here is to get you somewhat familiar with the project.
2. After having the time of your life, completing the step (1.), you now have a dozen feature ideas (or at least a single one), that would make Hawk even more amazing. So what are you waiting for? Fork the project, implement your ideas and I'll see you at the PR!

_P.S. if you need any help during any of this, see the support section!_
