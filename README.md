Hawk is a set of tools that can be used to detect and manipulate discriminative properties among elements. It is based on the concept of a pivot-comparison-feature triple.
We can affirm said triple is discriminative if the feature allows to discriminate the pivot from the comparison, that is, if it applies to the pivot but not to the comparison. Here's an example:

	- Pivot: Paris
	- Comparison: Barcelona
	- Feature: French

This is a discriminative triple: French applies to Paris because Paris is a French city, but not to Barcelona, since it isn't.It is important to mention that as soon as the feature and the comparison are related, the triple is not discriminative. Therefore, a triple where the feature does not apply to the pivot but to the comparison is still not discriminative.
